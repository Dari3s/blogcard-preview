### What I learned

While building this project, I improved my understanding of positioning elements using CSS. I faced challenges with layout and selecting the right CSS properties, but overcame them with the help of AI and experimentation.

I also learned how to use Flexbox more effectively and recently figured out how to import resources into my project, which was a breakthrough for me.
